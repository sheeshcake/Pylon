                                    Branding Strategy is the long-term planning and development of the success of a brand in order to achieve specific goals.

                                    Branding is giving an identity to your product.  Branding gives your target market, or even an audience who are unfamiliar of your products, a first impression of what your products and services are all about.  This increases your chances to be able to connect with your prospects and convert.
