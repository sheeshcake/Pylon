                        “We have a contract to provide and manage help desk for live virtual events for a major player in the event management industry, experiencing hypergrowth because of the pandemic.
                        We needed to scale up fast to manage the events for this client
                        We worked with Pylon to bring the team on board and train them to manage the virtual events, working with the client directly and with us when needing extra support.
                        I set Stephanie and Shaira a target; get your team to learn and do this well enough to be the first option for all events and to manage the bookings within 3 months.
                        They hit this goal in just 6 weeks, and have never looked back.
                        Clients are happy, the audience are happy, the events are successful and a year on, I look back on this contract that we won with pride; working with Pylon has been a joy and we do all we can to help this team to grow and thrive.”
